When creating objects in Exchange and cannot set the location of the created object (OU - Organization Units)

This means that the default value is set to display 500 items. You need to change the configuration file responsible for displaying the number of items

We must log in to Exchange server and find the location C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\ClientAccess\ecp next in the web.config file we add settings for the list of displayed objects

</appSettings>
...
<!-- allows the OU picker during placing a new mailbox in its designated Organizational Unit to retrieve all OUs - default value is 500 -->
<add key="GetListDefaultResultSize" value="2000" />
...
</appSettings>

If the list of objects still cannot be displayed, we must restart IIS service on the server or increase the counter and restart IIS.
